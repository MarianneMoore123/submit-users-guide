User's guide -- subMIT login pool
---------------------------------

Welcome to the subMIT users guide! This will guide you on how to make an account to access the submit machines and how to create basic and more advanced workflows for applications. We have examples and tutorials to help you get going.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The subMIT login pool is designed to let users login safely prepare and tests their research computing tasks and submit them to the large computing resource of their choice. There are for now a limited number of resources connected but we are working on quickly expanding the available resources.

We have HTcondor connection to the Tier-2 computing cluster, the Tier-2 integration cluster (aka Tier-3) in building 24, the engaging cluster and the OSG. For CMS users the global CMS queue is also seamlessly integrated.

What do I need for an account?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make login convenient and secure we allow login to the subMIT pool using ssh keys only. Go to our `submit portal <https://submit-portal.mit.edu>`_ to upload your ssh key (or a number of keys). Upload of ssh keys is secured through MIT touchstone authentication. This means users must have an MIT account.

It is straightforward to obtain an MIT guest account if you do not have one. A sponsor---usually a faculty you are working with---can request a guest account for you. The information needed for this sponsoring request is: first, last name and birthday. See the `sponsoring web page <https://ist.mit.edu/guest-accounts>`_. Please note: the process has to be started by the sponsor! The response by MIT IS&T has been very quick in the past, we have so far received all account requests in less than 4 hours.
